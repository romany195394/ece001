The computer consists of three main parts
 Which :
 .Memory 1
 .Input / output Ports
 Central Processing Unit (CPU).
Memory: Where programs are stored to implement, data to be processed and secondary memory, a permanent volume used to store software, software and data permanently until you need it as hard and flexible and integrated devices. The memory is divided into the computer into two
•	 main sectionsTypes of memory                  
•	       the main memory                   
•	     the secondary memory
•	() Unit entry :)
 Through which programs are entered and different Types of information to the main computer memory such as a keyboard, mouse and stick Control, pen and scanner Output unit) The output unit :) It outputs various types Information from the computer to the outside world, such as displays and printers Plotters and headphones.
Bus: 
These units are linked together inside the computer Using three types of buses: 
•	bus add
•	Control bus
•	Digital logic
It uses The binary counting system has only two numbers which are zero and one or two states which is a case True and False, in which various operations can be performed Mathematical and logical simpler than other counting systems, especially the counting system Decimal. The most important characteristic of this system is the ease of building mathematical and logical machines Simple keys are used to represent the number one by closing the key while
The slot represents the number zero, or vice versa, and can be done by connecting several switches on Straight or parallel
