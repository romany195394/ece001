The term computer architecture (or computer building) is used to denote science that studies the concepts that link the physical, physical components of a computer with the software components represented in the operating system.  The scientist has defined the architecture of computer architecture as the characteristics of the computer (computer properties) that appear programmed in the assembly language, and appear in the structure of concepts and functional models (software).  The concept of computer architecture was based on the design of a set of instructions directed to local networks, after which the focus would be on the design of the CPU, the memory unit hierarchy, the I / O system, parallel processes, and other aspects.
